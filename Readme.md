# stardb-exporter with artifact exporter

This is a fork of `stardb-exporter` with a feature to export artifacts as easily as achievements.

The feature is still in alpha testing, any comments are welcome!

You can download it here:
- [Windows](https://github.com/PJK136/stardb-exporter/releases/latest/download/stardb-exporter.exe)

It works the same way as the original `stardb-exporter`: run the game but don't go through the door, run the exporter, click on Artifact Exporter, go through the door, and wait for a button to copy the artifacts to your clipboard. It will be in the [GOOD](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/doc) format so it is ready to be imported anywhere else.

I haven't changed any other functionality including the sponsored section so I'm not related to anything else except the Artifact Exporter.

The protocol parser is also a fork I made to add the support for artifacts: [auto-artifactarium](https://github.com/PJK136/auto-artifactarium).

This is my first project in Rust, so please forgive me for any bad practices in the code. ðŸ˜…

If you're interested, I can maintain it, add more features (e.g., exporting weapons, setting a minimum level for exporting, etc.) and/or make a pull request upstream.

The feature doesnâ€™t specifically require `stardb-exporter` (but thanks to them, I was able to release this first version so easily!). If thereâ€™s demand for it, I can also try to make it standalone or integrate it into other tools.

Youâ€™re also free to reuse the code (at least the part I wrote) and improve it however you want, I'm glad to share the knowledge with other players. Just please credit me somewhere in your work.

Feel free to reach out to me here in this repository or on Discord with any questions.

Thanks to [@IceDynamix](https://github.com/IceDynamix), [@hashblen](https://github.com/hashblen), and [@juliuskreutz](https://github.com/juliuskreutz/stardb-exporter) for their publicly available work, which made this possible.

Thank you [@hashblen](https://github.com/hashblen) for creating protocol parsers that don't need any further updates ([auto-reliquary](https://github.com/hashblen/auto-reliquary) and [auto-artifactarium](https://github.com/hashblen/auto-artifactarium))!
